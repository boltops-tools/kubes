## Generated Wrapper

The standalone installer creates a wrapper script in `/usr/local/bin`.

    /usr/local/bin/kubes

Most users have `/usr/local/bin` configured in their PATH. So this wrapper should work immediately.

Important: If you have a wrapper in `/usr/local/bin` already, the installer will overwrite it.
